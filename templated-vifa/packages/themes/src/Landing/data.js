And one thing I would like to add to about CLI tools - I have never seen solution like this but it's awesome. I'm sure thanks to this everyone, even someone which isn't react specialist, will be able to create own website. Good job!`,

Thanks to that you can easily adjust Gatsby or Next.JS version to your preferences and attach to it whatever data source what you want to use. It can be done by overwriting props in pages which are using containers, changing default props directly in containers or you can change directly in the source code of containers the content to omit using props for maintaining data.
